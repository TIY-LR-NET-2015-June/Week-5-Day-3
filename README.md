   when you run 'update-database'
1. When you go to "http://localhost:3000" it should list all posts (title and
   body)
1. You should click on the title and go to "http://localhost:3000/posts/:id" and
   display the title and body
1. If I go to /posts/new I should see a form to write a new post
1. It should require content for title, body, and publishedOnDate
1. I should be able to click on a post, and then click an edit button
1. When I edit, it should populate the form with the post, and allow me to edit and update
The form should be a partial as to not duplicate effort between New and Edit
